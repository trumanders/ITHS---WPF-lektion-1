Testing WPF and files
This WPF application let's the user enter a first name, last name, and email.
The added entries are then shown on the screen.
The info can be saved to a file by clicking the save-button.
By clicking the button Show saved / Hide saved, the content of the saved entries in the file are toggled.
When saving to file, the entries in the local/in-memory list are cleared.
